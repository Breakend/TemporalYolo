# TemporalYolo
Experiments on temporal YOLO for detection of an Aqua-type amphibious hexapod for the purpose of tracking-by-detection and visual servo-ing during a robot convoying task.

NOTE: The pure ROLO code we take from https://github.com/Guanghan/ROLO and modify for our experiments and benchmarks. There are significant differences between our implementation and theirs.
